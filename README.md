# DanasWatherStation

This is final project work for uni. It's a mini arduino powered weather station that has sensors such as:
    - DHT22
    - BMP180
    - MQ-7
    - MQ-135
    - Optical dust sensor
    - PM2.5 dust sensor

The values that this sensors provide is send to ThingSpeak on a private weather channel.To send this data I use ENC28J60 ethernet module.
